Vector graphics made from curves
==========
##
Representation of vector images(encoding)

- image made out of objects
- used when we need to draw an image fast
- using sine and cosine functions to get new point locations

###
interpolation

- drawing polynomials
- works when there is a small amount of points to be drawn

###
aproximation

- we have many points and we need to draw a line that goes through them
- linear depencency based on 2 parameters
- when there is an approximate dependency between some parameters, but not mathematical dependency
- aproximation between bodyweight and height

###
bizier curves

- aka B-Spline
- connect 2 lines
- find their middles
- draw 2 more lines from the middle points and so on ...

- divided into 3 points and 4th degree polynomials
